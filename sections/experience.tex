      \begin{itemize}
            \item Worked on pushing state-of-the-art techniques even further for specialized tasks (increasing accuracy or inference time (depending on requirements)).
            Ensured applicability and feasability, (ie. scalability, feasability of running on available data). \\
            For example using transfer learning, or scaling down models, or translating data, depending on how much data is available vs client requirements.
            \item Evaluated, compared systems and checked client requirements.
            \item Directly technically interviewed over 10 research candidates.
            \item Supervised, lead, and trained newly recruited researchers.
            \item Negotiated deals and provided consultation on collaborating and participated in decisions costing over \$100,000. Such as research collaborations as well as purchasing hardware, inspected hardware specifications and made sure requirements were met.
            \item Improved workflow and efficiency by pushing for new methods/systesms/workflows. Also finalizing stail decisions that took too long.
      \end{itemize}
